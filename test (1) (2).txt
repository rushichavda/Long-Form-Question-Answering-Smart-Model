We know about people who lived in the
subcontinent as early as two million years ago.
Today, we describe them as hunter-gatherers. The
name comes from the way in which they got their
food. Generally, they hunted wild animals, caught
fish and birds, gathered fruits, roots, nuts, seeds,
leaves, stalks and eggs.
  Hunter-gatherers moved from place to place.
There are many reasons for this.
  First, if they had stayed at one place for a long
time, they would have eaten up all the available
plant and animal resources. Therefore, they would
have had to go elsewhere in search of food.
  Second, animals move from place to place —
either in search of smaller prey, or, in the case of
deer and wild cattle, in search of grass and leaves.
That is why those who hunted them had to follow
their movements.
  Third, plants and trees bear fruit in different
seasons. So, people may have moved from season
to season in search of different kinds of plants.
  Fourth, people, plants and animals need water
to survive. Water is found in lakes, streams and
rivers. While many rivers and lakes are perennial
(with water throughout the year) others are
seasonal. People living on their banks would have
had to go in search of water during the dry seasons
(winter and summer).
  Archaeologists have found some of the things
hunter-gatherers made and used. It is likely
that people made and used tools of stone,
wood and bone, of which stone tools have
survived best.
  Some of these stone tools were used to cut
meat and bone, scrape bark (from trees) and
hides (animal skins), chop fruit and roots. Some
may have been attached to handles of bone or
wood, to make spears and arrows for hunting.
Other tools were used to chop wood, which was
used as firewood. Wood was also used to make
huts and tools.
  Look at Map 2 below. All the places marked with
red triangles are sites from which archaeologists
have found evidence of hunter-gatherers. (Huntergatherers lived in many more places. Only some
are shown on the map). Many sites were located
near sources of water, such as rivers and lakes.
  Bhimbetka (in present day Madhya Pradesh).
This is an old site with
caves and rock shelters.
People chose these
natural caves because
they provided shelter
from the rain, heat and
wind. These rock
shelters are close to the
Narmada valley. Can
you think of why people
chose to live here?
  As stone tools were important, people tried to
find places where good quality stone was easily
available.
  Many of the caves in which these early people
lived have paintings on the walls. Some of the
best examples are from Madhya Pradesh and
southern Uttar Pradesh. These paintings show
wild animals, drawn with great accuracy and skill.
  are places where the remains of things (tools, pots,
buildings etc.) were found. These were made, used
and left behind by people. These may be found on
the surface of the earth, buried under the earth, or
sometimes even under water. You will learn more
about different sites in later chapters.
  Find the Kurnool caves on Map 2 (page13). Traces
of ash have been found here. This suggests that
people were familiar with the use of fire. Fire could
have been used for many things: as a source of
light, to roast meat, and to scare away animals.
What do we use fire for today?
  Archaeologists have given lengthy names for the time that we are studying.
They call the earliest period the Palaeolithic. This comes from two Greek
words, ‘palaeo’, meaning old, and ‘lithos’, meaning stone. The name points
to the importance of finds of stone tools. The Palaeolithic period extends
from 2 million years ago to about 12,000 years ago. This long stretch of
time is divided into the Lower, Middle and Upper Palaeolithic. This long
span of time covers 99% of human history.
  The period when we find environmental changes, beginning about
12,000 years ago till about 10,000 years ago is called the Mesolithic (middle
stone). Stone tools found during this period are generally tiny, and are
called microliths. Microliths were probably stuck on to handles of bone or
wood to make tools such as saws and sickles. At the same time, older
varieties of tools continued to be in use.
  The next stage, from about 10,000 years ago, is known as the Neolithic.
What do you think the term Neolithic means?
  We have also mentioned the names of some places. You will find the
names of many more places in later chapters. Very often, we use presentday names of the places where people lived in the past, because we do not
know what they called them.
  Around 12,000 years ago, there were major
changes in the climate of the world, with a shift
to relatively warm conditions. In many areas, this
led to the development of grasslands. This in turn
led to an increase in the number of deer, antelope,
goat, sheep and cattle, i.e. animals that survived
on grass.
  Those who hunted these animals now followed
them, learning about their food habits and their
breeding seasons. It is likely that this helped
people to start thinking about herding and rearing
these animals themselves. Fishing also became
important.
  This was also a time when several grain bearing
grasses, including wheat, barley and rice grew
naturally in different parts of the subcontinent.
Men, women and children probably collected
these grains as food, and learnt where they grew,
and when they ripened. This may have led them
to think about growing plants on their own. In
this way people became farmers.
  People could also attract and then tame animals
by leaving food for them near their shelters. The
first animal to be tamed was the wild ancestor of
the dog. Later, people encouraged animals that
were relatively gentle to come near the camps
where they lived. These animals such as sheep,
goat, cattle and also the pig lived in herds, and
most of them ate grass. Often, people protected
these animals from attacks by other wild animals.
This is how they became herders.
  If you plant a seed, you will notice that it takes
some time to grow. This may be for several days,
weeks, months and in some cases years. When
people began growing plants, it meant that they
had to stay in the same place for a long time
looking after the plants, watering, weeding,
driving away animals and birds — till the
grain ripened. And then, the grain had to be
used carefully.
  As grain had to be stored for both food and
seed, people had to think of ways of storing it. In
many areas, they began making large clay pots,
or wove baskets, or dug pits into the ground. Do
you think hunter-gatherers would have made and
used pots? Give reasons for your answer.
  Animals multiply naturally. Besides, if they are
looked after carefully, they provide milk, which is
an important source of food, and meat, whenever
required. In other words, animals that are reared
can be used as a ‘store’ of food.
  You will notice a number
of blue squares. Each marks a site from where
archaeologists have found evidence of early
farmers and herders. These are found all over the
subcontinent. Some of the most important ones
are in the north-west, in present-day Kashmir,
and in east and south India.
  To find out whether these sites were settlements
of farmers and herders, scientists study evidence
of plants and animal bones. One of the most
exciting finds includes remains of burnt grain.
(These may have been burnt accidentally or on
purpose). Scientists can identify these grains, and
so we know that a number of crops were grown in
different parts of the subcontinent. They can also
identify the bones of different animals.
This is how they became herders.
  Archaeologists have found traces of huts or houses
at some sites. For instance, in Burzahom (in
present-day Kashmir) people built pit-houses,
which were dug into the ground, with steps leading
into them. These may have provided shelter in cold
weather. Archaeologists have also found cooking
hearths both inside and outside the huts, which
suggests that, depending on the weather, people
could cook food either indoors or outdoors.
  Stone tools have been found from many sites
as well. Many of these are different from the earlier
Palaeolithic tools and that is why they are called
Neolithic. These include tools that were polished
to give a fine cutting edge, and mortars and pestles
used for grinding grain and other plant produce.
Mortars and pestles are used for grinding grain
even today, several thousand years later. At the
same time, tools of the Palaeolithic types
continued to be made and used, and remember,
some tools were also made of bone.
  Many kinds of earthen pots have also been
found. These were sometimes decorated, and were
used for storing things. People began using pots
for cooking food, especially grains like rice, wheat
and lentils that now became an important part of
the diet. Besides, they began weaving cloth, using
different kinds of materials, for example cotton,
that could now be grown.
  Did things change everywhere and all at once?
Not quite. In many areas, men and women still
continued to hunt and gather food, and elsewhere
people adopted farming and herding slowly, over
several thousand years. Besides, in some cases
people tried to combine these activities, doing
different things during different seasons.
  This site is
located in a fertile plain, near the Bolan Pass,
which is one of the most important routes into
Iran. Mehrgarh was probably one of the places
where people learnt to grow barley and wheat,
and rear sheep and goats for the first time in this
area. It is one of the earliest villages that we know
about. At this site many animal bones were found.
Bones of wild animals such as the deer and pig,
and also bones of sheep and goat were found.
  Other finds at Mehrgarh include remains of
square or rectangular houses. Each house had
four or more compartments, some of which may
have been used for storage.
  When people die, their relatives and friends
generally pay respect to them. People look after
them, perhaps in the belief that there is some
form of life after death. Burial is one such
arrangement. Several burial sites have been
found at Mehrgarh. In one instance, the dead
person was buried with goats, which were
probably meant to serve as food in the next world.
  Find France in your atlas. The painting below is
from a cave in France. This site was discovered by
four school children more than a hundred years
ago. Paintings like this were made between 20,000
and 10,000 years ago. Many of these were of
animals, such as wild horses, aurochs (an older,
wild form of cattle), bison, woolly rhinoceros,
reindeer and bear, painted in bright colours.
  These colours were made from minerals like
ochre or iron ore, and charcoal. It is possible that
these paintings were done on ceremonial occasions.
Or perhaps they were made for special rituals,
performed by hunters before they went in search of
prey?
  Find Turkey in your atlas. One of the most famous
Neolithic sites, Catal Huyuk, was found in Turkey.
Several things were brought from great distances
—flint from Syria, cowries from the Red Sea, shells
from the Mediterranean Sea — and used in the
settlement. Remember, there were no carts — most
things would have been carried on the backs of
pack animals such as cattle or by people.

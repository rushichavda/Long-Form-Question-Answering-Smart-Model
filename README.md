Problem statement:                                                                                                  
If i explain the problem in very laymen language, then its like open book examination
I was supposed to make a model which can answer descriptive as well as short questions based on the text we provide to the model.

Its a dificult task because to make it possible, model should have contexual knowledge of the question as well as text which we provide to it.

Solution:                                                                                                               
I used BERT large language model and repharasing libraries of NLP to accomplish the task, the model can give human-like answers for descriptive questions and accurate answers to short questions.
